# DevOpsify

Description
------------
An assistance platform made using Spring framework that analyses your code, and helps you either to start a devops
project, or to turn an existing project into a devops project using open source software (Git, Docker, Jenkins..)

The main aim of this project is to develop a server application that automizes some parts of
the DevOps cycle, does a "DevOps analysis" for projects and gives some feedback to developers
on things to improve.

UseCases
------------
So far, the only use case we have is creating a new project and generating jenkinsfiles, dockerfiles while creating a
new pipeline in jenkins
